<p><strong>Scope: </strong>(<em>To understand the audit scope, review the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks/supplement/I8hEO/more-about-security-audits">security audit</a> reading. Note that the scope is not constant from audit to audit. However, once the scope of the audit is clearly defined, only items within scope should be audited. In this scenario, the scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures</em>).
</p>

</p>
<ul>

<li>Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
