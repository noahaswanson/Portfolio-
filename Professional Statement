Hello, my name is Noah Swanson. I'm an aspiring cybersecurity analyst with strong written and verbal communication skills as well as having a natural intuition for navigating technology and understanding new interfaces. I have a passion for helping people and protecting information, as well as a passion for learning new and exciting ways to use technology. Some of the ways that the field of cybersecurity most interests me is the technical challenge of of learning how to protect important data and information, as well as having the opportunity to have a positive and ethical influence on the way information is handled. I believe that my attention to detail as well as my strong moral compass will be a huge asset to any security team.
